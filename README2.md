# Movie IMBd App 
In this project I tried to build an app that provides you data about movies. In this app you can search, update, create, and delete data. You can use the app to reseasrch basic information about movies and actors. Enjoy the app!

 Respository - https://github.com/valeriiahutsuliak94/guided-module-one-project-assessment-chicago-web-100719
 Forked and clone respository. 

# To run:
Type "bundle install" in your terminal to make sure you have all the needed gems.

# Gems used:
gem "sinatra-activerecord"
gem "sqlite3"
gem "pry"
gem "require_all"
gem 'rest-client'
gem 'artii'
gem 'rainbow'

To start the application, enter 'ruby bin/run.rb' in your terminal.


Run MovieApp from you command line by entering:
ruby bin/run.rb

The MoviApp should pop up in your terminal

Select an option from the main menu to proceed:
  "Movie search",
        "Create movie",
        "Movie update",
        "Movie delete",
        "List of the movie names in ascending order",
        "List of the movie names in descending order",
        "Search by genre",
        "Find movie by actor name",
        "Find a list of actors that are in the movie",
        "Top 5 movies",
        "To 5 actors",
        "For exit"

For example, to see the movie by genre, enter:
"Search by genre"
Then, type in:

Then, you will see:
